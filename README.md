# artificial_neural_nets
some of the projects i did in a artificial neural net class

each directory is a seperate network 

the mnist_convo and mnist_tensorf are for the same project. One uses a dense nn and the other uses a convolutional nn. 
The purpose is to compare the two methods. 

directory has the script in it along with necessary files to go with it and files for pycharm. each project has a report 
in the directory.

all projects where done in python in pycharm. In the class i used numpy, pandas, tensor flow and tflearn.
